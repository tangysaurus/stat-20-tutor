I think somebody said that one of the indexes didn't have data for a particular date that we set. Okay, that's due on Monday. And other than that noun. Any questions about anything? All right, so what I want to do today is I want to finish talking about financial assets kind of as random variables and talking about their expected returns and the standard deviation of those returns. Standard deviation is often referred to in finance as volatility. So the expected return and the volatility of the return. And then we'll mention a particular measure, that particular quantity that measures the trade off between expected return and volatility. That's something called the sharpe ratio. And then the bulk of today will be concerned with the idea of arbitrage. What is an arbitrage opportunity? And one of the things that we typically assume in finance is that there are no arbitrary, that you really need, have no arbitrage opportunities to have a well functioning financial market. As I said, there are, in fact, arbitrage opportunities out there, but they're typically exploited so fast that especially you or I, almost no chance of trying to take advantage of any arbitrage anyway. So that's kind of where we're headed today. Questions about any of that? Okay, so where we left off last time is we're thinking of financial assets, really, it's random. Various financial assets. They have an initial price, and then we assume that we know the distribution of the potential payoff of that asset or the potential return of that asset. This particular case here that we started to look at, this is an example of an asset that has a discrete number of possible payoffs, and hence a discrete number of possible returns. We will also consider assets that have a continuous continuum, possible gas returns. And one of the common assumptions, at least for returns, is that returns follow a normal distribution. That's not a great assumption, but it is often made. There are other, of course, assumptions that you could make, but let's just continue. I want to continue with this discrete case. So we're thinking of an asset that starts out with a price of 100 and has three. When we write something like this down, we think that there's, we know somehow, we know that there are only three cases. Either the assets is going to go to 110 after one period, it's going to stay at 100, or it's going to drop to 95 after one period. And somehow we assume that we know that. And we assume that we know what the distribution, what the probability distribution over those payoffs. In this case, there's a 15% chance it goes to 100%, a 60% chance. It stays at 125% chance and it drops to 95. So that's the idea again, just last time. That's the idea of risk versus uncertainty. With risk, we assume we know what the distribution is over the possible outcome. Uncertainty would be the case where we don't, we don't even know. We have no idea what these numbers are here. We're always dealing with risk in this class. All right, so if it goes to 110, we have returned 10%. That pays. With 100, we have a return of 0% and a net simple return. And if it goes to negative five, we have a net simple return of -5% now, how do you know we have this distribution of payoffs and potential returns? Often we try to summarize these distributions into just a couple of numbers, one or two numbers. And the most common numbers that get used to summarize distributions of return are the expected returns and the volatility of variance. The variance of the return are the standard deviation volatility of the return. So let's just go through quickly and calculate what the expectation of the expected return and variance is in this particular example. So, expected return, if you recall, expectation of a random variable is just a probability weighted sum if it's possible outcome. Typically, we're concerned about returns as opposed to payoff. So we'll look at the expected return of this particular asset. Okay, so what's the expected return? I'll call it. This is my symbol for expectation. This is the expected return. This is the probability weighted sum. So we've got 0.15. That's the probability that we get a 10% return. I'm just going to sum up. I'm going to weight the possible return by their probabilities and sum them up. And so I've got a 60% chance that our return is zero. Zero. And then I've got a 25% chance that our return is -5% or. -0.05 this is going to be the expected return of this asset. So the expectations is telling you what the center of the distribution is, doesn't tell you anything about what the extremes are, but I'll tell you what the center is. And I believe this turns out to be 25 basis points. So this turns out to be 0.0025. Right? So this is 0.25%. Okay, so now let me introduce you to some terminology that you often hear in finance, especially when you're talking about fixed income, talking about bonds. You'll hear the terminology a lot. So this is, this quantity is referred to as 25 basis points. 25 basis points. So eight basis points is one 100th of a percent, is 100 basis points. This is 0.25%. This is 25 basis points. So people, especially in the fixed income markets, commonly talk about things moving in terms of basis points. 30 year t bill or the 30 year treasury bond, I should say, is up 50 basis points. Good thing to know about. All right, so that's the, this is a measure of kind of the center of this distribution. And now we want to think about a measure of spread of this distribution. And often in finance, variance or standard deviation is used to measure the, what we think of as the risk of this asset. So the more spread out the distribution is for the payoffs of the return, the riskier we think of an asset as being. So, variance, if you recall, hopefully you recall, like, the expectation variance is a probability weight sum, but the probability weighted sum of the square of the possible outcomes, the difference between the possible outcomes and their mean, the probability weighted sum of the squared deviations of a random variable. So, variance we often use, okay, this, another notation that we use for the mean is mu r. So mu r. And these two ways of writing the expectation of mean of a random variable are exactly the same. They're completely synonymous, and I will use them interchangeably depending on the situation. So what do we use for variance? Well, the variance, we just, right, typically, we write r r or sigma squared. So those are two completely synonymous ways of writing the variance of the return. Okay, so what is the variance? Well, the variance is going to be if I take the probability, and I've got to multiply this by square of the deviation of this return, in this case, from its mean. So what's the mean? Well, my possible outcome is 10%. My mean is 0025. And then I square that. Now I have to add in the second number, probability weight, 0.6. I've got zero -0.0025 squared. And finally, I've got my 25% chance. I get a -5% return of -0.05 -0.0025 that's going to be the variance of my return. Variance of my return. So what do we get in this case? This gives us 0.0016. So that's the variance. Now, the variance issues with the variance, and that makes it a little bit hard to interpret, of course, is that this is in squared units of return. So typically, we will talk about the standard deviation or the volatility of the return, and that's simply the square root of the variance. So wait for writing that we would write standard r or sigma. Very often we would use sigma notation to indicate variance or volatility. Standard deviation or also volatility. We call that volatility. So in this case, this turns out to be, I just take the square root of that. So that's 0.0405. So now I'm in the same units as the expected return. And so this is, you say the volatility is 4.053 square root of the variance. And that's the only way to calculate standard deviation. You gotta calculate the variance first and then take the square root. All right. Now, that number doesn't really tell you anything by itself. Typically, what we would do is we want to compare, we might have a handful of assets that we're thinking about investing in, and we want to compare both their expected returns and their standard deviation of their volatility. If I have two assets with the same expected return, typically I would prefer one that had a smaller volatility, less risk for the same expected account. And one of the central ideas in finances is that there is a trade off between expected return and volatility. We typically expect assets that have higher volatility to have higher expected return, compensate investors for that increase in risk. Questions about that? Okay, so another type of asset that is very important to financial economics is what we call a risk free asset. And risk free asset, this means that it's an asset that has the same payoff in every state, so that there's essentially no uncertainty about the payout, which is called a risk free asset. There's no risk in the asset. We know what the return is going to be. So that'd be the case. Say we have an asset. Third, and in every possible state, it goes for 101. So there's no uncertainty. No matter what happens. I've got a return of 1%. And of course, hence, the expected return of this asset will be 1%. This would be a so called risk free asset. And these are very important things that are considered risk free out there, typically with government, us government securities. And so we're typically measuring expected returns of securities relative to the returns of risk free securities. And there's some particular terminology involved with that. Sure, I take it. So get it backwards. So prior, prior to knowing what the outcome is like, which state we end up in, prior to knowing that, we refer to the difference between the expected return of a risky asset. So this would be considered a risky asset. Here we've got a risk free asset. The difference between the expected return to a risky asset and the risk free asset we referred to as the risk premium. Prior to resolving the uncertainty, the risk premium would be the difference between the expected return of the risky asset and the expected return of the risk free asset, which in our case here, the risk premium would actually be negative. The expected return of this asset was 0.0025. The expected return of the risk free asset is 0.011 -75 basis point risk free. And then once the uncertainty is dissolved. So we're looking at historical data. We refer to the difference between the expected return or the historical return and the return of the risk free assets as the excess return. So the difference between risk premium and excess return is the question timing. Risk premium is prior to a resolution, the uncertainty. Excess return is after resolution of the uncertainty. Okay, questions about that. Just some terminology. Often people will use those terminals terms interchangeably, technically. Okay. And then, as I said, we're usually trying to. We're thinking about, we've got several assets that we're looking at, and they've got different expected returns and different standard deviations. You know, we're thinking about trying to trade off expected return with volatility. Volatility, standard deviation. There's one particular measure that there are many measures that do this, but one that is commonly used, I should say one measure that's commonly used for trading off expected return and volatility is something called a sharp ratio. And many of you have probably seen this term or heard about this term. If you look up the security on any of the financial services sites, you'll typically see a summary data about security. So what is the sharpe ratio? Can we use an s to denote the sharpe ratio? So what it is, it is the expected return. Risk premium, I should say. So here's some notation. We use a little sub app to indicate a risk free security. This just indicates a risk free security and that simple returns a risk free security. And we don't need an expectation operator in front of us because it's just a certain quantity. Remember that the expectation of a constant is just a constant. And then we divide this by the volatility of this risk premium. So this is defined as the sharp ratio. Of course, since the risk free asset, since this is a constant, we can also write this expected as a risk premium, just divided by standard deviation. So this is called sharp ratio. Very ubiquitous measure out there. So this is something that we had a bunch of assets with different expectations, different expected returns, and different volatilities. We can calculate this sharpe ratio, and we could use that sharpe ratio to pick out assets, right? We would typically like to have assets at a higher sharpe ratio. Higher sharpe, also referred to as a risk adjusted excess return or just risk adjusted return. And so if we have a higher sharpe ratio, that means we have a higher risk premium, if you will, per unit of risk. Okay. Now, there are a lot of issues with ratio. It's commonly used, but just because it can be done doesn't mean it should be done, necessarily. A couple of, one of the issues is that, and this is a big topic, especially if you get to higher level financial economics. The thing that we're using to measure risk here is the standard deviation. There are a lot of things, a lot of ways that you can measure the risk of a security. One of the issues that people have with standard deviation, of course, is that it equally weights very large returns with very small returns. Large returns are typically thought of as being desirable. So there are a lot of different measures that can be used to measure risk. What we will typically use in this class is we'll follow the kind of follow the crowd, if you will. We will use volatility. And another thing is that this risk measure, in particular, what it's doing is it is weighting. So this is saying that, okay, I essentially place equal weight in this on my expected return and volatility, what could be. And that represents a certain set of preferences for an investor. So if I am a very risk averse investor, I may want to place a higher rate risk than I do on the expected return. And this measure, then, would be inappropriate for me. Or bisexual. That said, very commonly used, probably the most commonly used measure of risk adjusted deterrence out there. And it was developed by a guy called William Sharp, who maybe we will see again when we talk about capital asset pricing model. And he is probably american now, but he was a professor at the Stanford business, came up with this sharpe ratio back in the mid sixties. Probably one of the most famous names in all of finance. All right, any questions about that? I just want to make you aware of the sharp ration. Okay, good. Okay, so, as I said, the central theme of today's class is going to be something called arbitrage. As I mentioned, we typically assume in finance to kind of get anywhere, at least theoretically, is that there are no arbitrage opportunities available to us. So, let me define what an arbitrage opportunity is. So, there's two parts, two pieces to an arbitrage opportunity. The first piece is that it is a case where you set up a portfolio or set up a trade or something, and you have no, zero probability that you lose money at any point, either right now or at any time in the future. There's no chance of losing money at any point. That's one piece of it. The other piece of an arbitrage opportunity is that either you make some money today and you still have zero chance of losing money in the future, or you're able to set up this trade or opportunity for no cost and you have a positive, strictly positive probability of making money in the future. Doesn't mean that you will make money in the future for sure, but you have a strictly positive probability of making it. And terminology is when you get to higher levels of financial, financial economics. The first case where I make money today, really I put money in my pocket today and I have no chance of losing money in the future. This is referred to as a type one arbitrage. And then the second case, where I'm able to set up a position with no cost today, have a positive probability of making money in the future, is referred to as a type two arbitrage. Yes. Is that nominally or is that it doesn't. So we're just talking about making money. Could be a penny, could be $1,000. So we're talking about zero, making zero, or making positive. Okay, so now type one and type two are not real. That terminology is common to hear from people talking about arbitrary, but not really that important. It's just terminology again. But type one refers to the case where I make money today and I've got no possibility of losing money in the future. Type two would be the case where I set up a position for no cost today, and I have a positive probability of making money in the future. And of course, zero probability of losing money. And we'll look at both, we'll look at many examples, both types of these today. Okay, so let's start off with an extremely simple example. And this would be the case of like a type one arbitrage. So suppose I have box. The box of twelve temple sells for the misses all today, $1. And then individual pencils seller, $0.10. Alright. And we'll assume that there's no cost for packaging. And we'll assume that demand is infinite. Okay, so this would be in this case, you could set up what we call a type one arbitrage, right? You could purchase a box of pencils for a dollar. And you can turn around and sell those twelve pencils individually for $0.10 each. You make $1.20. So every time you do that, you're going to have a net profit of $0.20, you're going to put $0.20 into your pocket. We'll also assume, just for sake of argument, that you can do these transactions essentially. And so I'm just putting my, putting money in my pocket. Every time I do this I get a net 20 cent. So you know, this opportunity, we're available to do this all day long, many times with pop. Okay, so that's very simple. We would consider this a kind of type one arbitrage, to be dantic about it in a type two arbitrage. So let's suppose, let's suppose that we're thinking about price of pencils in the future. Let's close that. There's two cases. So I'm sitting here today and saying, okay, there's two things that can happen. Either a box of pencils will cost $1.20 in the future or a box of pencils will cost a dollar five. And actually the probabilities don't really matter. Let's just say that these are two things that could happen. And then let's say that box of pencils today sells for a dollar. And then let's say that I can borrow money if I want, I can borrow money. And the borrowing rate, if the borrowing rate is 5%. So for every dollar I borrow today, today, this is some point in the future. For every dollar I borrowed today, I've got payback of dollar five. Ok? So in this case I would have what we call a type two arbitrage opportunity. So what I can do to take advantage of that is I can borrow a dollar. I suppose I don't have any money, but I can take advantage. I can go borrow a dollar today, purchase the box of pencils, and then in the future when I get to here, and my uncertainty is some probability, doesn't really matter what it is, I get to the future and I can either sell that box to temples for $1.20 per dollar cost. If I can sell the box of temples for $1.20, I do that, I pay back my loan for $1.05 and I've got a net profit of $0.15. That's one case. And with this case I sell my box of pencils for $1.05. I've got to take that dollar five and turn around and pay back my loan. And I've got zero net profit. The main point is. So in this case I make 15, in this case I make zero. But the main thing to be aware of here is that I have no chance of losing money. I either cover and break even, or I make a positive profit. And I will get positive profit with probability p, and I'll break even with Probability one minus. And so the idea here is that p is some number. P is some number between zero and one. It's not equal to one. It's not equal to zero. So I've got a chance, I don't lose any money today. I didn't borrow the dollar, and then I've got a positive chance of making money. I won't make money necessarily. I've got a positive probability of making money, and I've got no probability still, you would do this for as much money as somebody would be willing to lend you. There's no risk. You have to break even or you make a bunch of them. Doesn't cost you anything. Any questions about that? Yeah, so, as I said, in finance theory, we assume that these types of opportunities come existential. You can already see what the problem is, that they did exist. Right. People would be piling into this trade, probably cause prices to move, probably cause the current price of the assets move up to the point where there were no more arbitrage opportunities. Now. Yeah. So we assume that there are no arbitrary opportunities. And again, if there are, we assume that they're eliminated so quickly that we can't take advantage. Yes. Does type two arbitrage almost always involve borrowing money, or are there other ways to set that up? Usually it does. I mean, well, we'll come back. But yet either borrowing money or, as we'll talk about a little bit later, borrowing a security. Yeah, we're thinking about setting up a position without having any money come out of our pocket. So in this case, yes, we can start with nothing, borrow a dollar and get into the trade. We'll see later. We can start with nothing. We can borrow a security, use the proceeds from selling that security to set up a portfolio. Other questions about that? Yeah, just because I'm just putting money in my pocket right now, and nothing, nothing happens after that. I just get money now. There's no loss of any money. We'll look at a little bit more complicated example of type one coming up. Yeah. Isn't that essentially a short. Yeah, when we're borrowing money, we're shorting, and you can think of that as shorting a risk free security. We'll talk about that. Good. Other questions? Okay, so, yeah, I want to talk about arbitrage a little bit more formally, if you will. And what we're going to do is we're going to trans, we're going to use, I talked about using, this is one way of depicting uncertainty, time and uncertainty, if you will, supposed to be t zero. This is supposed to be t one. Another way that we typically use, and we will use a lot, especially when we're talking about arbitrage today, is we will use a table to represent uncertainty. And we did this last time, I think. So let's close what I've got. I've got several assets. Think about states of nature, if you will, in the future, and then current prices of exas, what the payoffs are in different states in the future and the prices of exists. And you could depict this with a tree as well. So let's just do a simple case where I've got two states and then I've got a current price. So the basic idea here is that the price is what I see today. We'll assume that that happens at t zero, and then these states are what happens in the future at t one. Now at t zero, I don't know which states will happen, but I'm assuming that one of these states will happen. These are uncertain states. And then what we'll do is we'll write up the data for these assets in here. So if state one occurs, for instance, let's say asset one will pay me four and state two occurs. Asset one will pay me zero and that will have a current price so I can purchase this asset for two today. And then if state one occurs, I get four. And if state two occurs, I get zero. You could write that using a tree with two branches on it. Either way, this is a very typical way of doing it. Alright, let's think about asset two. Maybe the payoff of six and zero and the price of four, and then I might have a third. Asset payoff is zero and two I will price. This is just a general way to depict uncertainty. All of these payoffs are uncertain, and the only thing that's certain is the price. Now, we can associate probabilities with these states, but as we'll see from all the discussion today, we don't really need probabilities. We think of this as PI one plus PI two. But we will never actually need the actual probability of these states. For what we discussed today, if you wanted to calculate expected return and volatility, you would need this probability. But for arbitrage purposes, we don't need those probabilities. Okay. And these are referred to in the, often referred to in the financial literature, we refer to these payoffs as state contingent payoffs. State contingent payoffs payoff for contingent, okay, so let's use this table. I'm going to get rid of acid three here. And the problem, so let's suppose that these are the two assets that are available to me at that asset 10, asset two, six and zero. These are prices. And so this is what's available to me question, is there an arbitrage opportunity available? Sounds kind of silly, but available in this economy. The question is, is there an arbitrage opportunity available to this economy? So we've got two approaches to answering this question. This has to do with type one and type two arbitrage. So we want to think about, okay, we want to see, is there a type one arbitrage in this economy? How do we figure that out? So what we try to do is we try to look for multiples. And so this is referred to as a state continuous. The whole thing is referred to as a state contingent payoff vector. This is the state contingent payout vector for asset one. This is state contented payout vector for asset two. We want to look for multiples of the payoff vector reaching my assets such that those multiples give you the same state contingent payoff. And I want to see if the price of those two things are different. So I would have a type one arbitrage available to me in this case, and we'll do many examples. The other way I can do it is I can look for a type two arbitrage. And what I try to do is I look for multiples that match up prices and then have kind of the same payoffs in most states and maybe a higher payout in at least one state and not a lower payoff in any states. We'll come back to some examples of this, but let's look at type one arbitrage first. That's the easier of the two. And so what I mean by multiples as well, let's try to match up the state contingent payoffs by taking multiples of these state contingent payout metrics. And very simple, if you like, to take, if I take a multiple of 1.5 shares, if you will, of asset one, and that will give me 1.5 shares. Okay, so I for every have 1.5 degrees of mass is one. So I mean, I'm multiplying the eight vectors by 1.5. In this position, state one occurs and zero is state two. Number, this is what I mean. So I think one share of asset two versus 1.45 shares of that one. Now, I've matched up the state contingent payoff activity. And the price of this? Well, it's going to be 1.5 times two plus three. So I've got two positions with the same state contingent payouts. In other words, one share of asset two, 1.5 shares of asset one. And both of those positions need to be the same state potential payoff. In other words, six in state one and zero and state two, they have different prices. This will give rise to a type one arbitrage. So let's suppose just initially that I own asset two. Suppose I own asset two. What can I do? Suppose I already own asset two. If I have asset two, what I can do is I can sell that asset for $4, and then I can turn around and take my $4 and purchase one and a half shares, one for $3. So, meaning I keep a dollar, I keep a dollar in my pocket right now. And when I get to, when the uncertainty is resolved, well, if I haven't changed, I haven't changed my options. Stage one occurs, I still get six. And if stage two occurs, I get zero, which is exactly the situation I had before. But I'm a dollar original. I've got a dollar in my pocket. So yes, there is an arbitrage opportunity in this economy. And so what's going to happen, let's say that there's many owners of each of these assets out there. So what's going to happen is that all of the owners of asset two are going to be selling asset two in order to take advantage of this and purchasing asset one. And they're going to keep. So that's going to put downward pressure on the price of asset, too. Put upward pressure on the price of asset one, and that selling and purchasing will continue until there is no arbitrage opportunity. So it's going to continue until the prices are such that there is no arbitrage opportunity. So that would have to continue. Essentially. I want to think about this in the abstract. So what's going to happen is that p price of asset one gets driven up, the price of asset two will get driven down up to the point where the price of asset two is exactly one and a half times the price of asset one. Why is that? Because the state contingent payout vector is exactly one and a half times the state continued payout vector of asset one. Yes. Yeah. You could go either way. And so in order to include arbitrage, I've got to have the price of s of two being equal to 1.5 times the price of SDE. So if that's the case, now I have no more archery. I have no arbitrage operations. So again, as pointed out, you can go either way here. So in other words, the price of asset two is greater than 1.5 price of asset one. Then I've got an arbitrage opportunity. I sell asset two. Two, I'd purchase asset one and then conversely, this is less than 1.5 times. Then I would sell asset one and purchase asset. And that would take place until we get to a point of equality. And that point of equality again, precludes any argument. Okay, so this is a very simple but extremely powerful concept in finance. Yeah. Four. I think this will probably lead into the next question. What do you unknown ask? So what happens? Well, this comes back to a question that was asked earlier. Let's say that I'm just sitting there on the sidelines. I have no interest in either one of these assets, but I want to take advantage of that initial arbitrage object. Let's go back to, go back to two and four. Okay, so I don't own either asset. So what can I do now? Can I take advantage of this opportunity? So there is an arbitrage opportunity. Can I take advantage of this arbitrage opportunity? The answer is yes, but what I can do essentially is short of five equals a negative amount of asset two called shorting. I'm going to sell or buy a negative amount. You can think of it that way if you like, buy a negative amount of asset tube. So I'm going to receive $4 for that short position. I'm going to turn around and I'm going to establish a long position in 1.5 shares of asset one. I'm going to sell one share of asset two and purchase 1.5, create what's called a long short portfolio. So I'm short one share of asset two and then I'm long 1.55 shares of S. Let's talk about shorting a little bit. So what does shorting mean exactly? What shorting means is that you borrow, say t zero. I'm going to borrow one share of asset two from somebody. I mean, the way it works in practice is your broker would do this on your path. Technically, you're borrowing a share of asset two and I'm going to sell it right now. Sell asset two right now. This is called taking a short position in asset two. And when you take a short position, short selling is very common. Actually, you take a short position in an asset, you're hoping to be able to purchase that asset in the future at a lower price. So it's a bet that the price of that asset is going to decline outside of portfolio context. So you can just do, many people do that. They've got a negative view on a stock, so instead of purchasing the stock, they'll sell it short. And shorting has a very bad rap in finance, unjustifiably. So if you ask me, as long as there are short sellers out there, as far as I'm concerned, providing service to the market is providing liquidity to the market. But if you go ask Dick folk, who is the head of Lehman Brothers, and Lehman Brothers went bankrupt during the financial crisis, he will tell you that it was because of those goddamn short sellers constantly shorting layman stock and driving depends on, it's kind of a philosophical argument, especially out there in the industry, whether short selling is a good thing or a bad thing. Like what's the difference between buying and selling? Just one side of the transaction. But anyway, so what we do, you sell the asset today, and then what's going to happen is in the future, you're going to have to pay to the person that you sold the asset to. You're going to have to give them whatever payoff into the asset. So you're on the hook for the payoff of the asset in the future if you short sell. Whereas if you buy something, you're buying it today, and then you get the payoff in the future, you're short selling, you sell it today, and you're paid. That you pay. Okay, so what happens in the future then for this portfolio, this long shorts portfolio? In state one. So in state one, I short or. Yes, on state one, I've shorted the share of asset two, and I've gone long, 1.5 shares of asset one. So what's my payoff going to be for this portfolio, I'm going to receive six for my 1.5 shares of asset one. But now I'm going to have to pay six for my short. Because I'm short one share of assets, I receive six, I pay six. My net payoff is zero. I break even. Same thing happens in state one. I get zero. For my long position, I pay zero. For my short position, I guess zero. So in either case, no matter what happens in the future, I have no net payoff. My net payoff is zero. And the way this is talked about in finance, people will often say I have no net exposure in the future. But what's going to happen here? So I shorted, I shorted a share of assets two. I received four for that I turned around and I paid for 1.5 trillion. I paid three, and so I pocketed $1. I put a dollar in my pocket right now, and I can do what I want with. Put a dollar in my pocket right now, and I've got no net exposure in the future. There's no possibility of losing money. This would be referred to as a type one arbitrage. I got money today and I can turn around and do what I like with that money. I've got no net exposure in the future. Say that again here. You're not hedging, you're just setting up a riskless. You've got no chance of losing anything in this case. So. Well, I guess you can think of it as tension, but it's a perfect hedge. Just think about it. Right now is I'm setting up a portfolio that's got no net future exposure, and I'm generating cash today to do that. Okay. So again, if you could find such an opportunity, you do that all day long. Why not? Questions about that. Yeah. Are these assets like. I mean, these are just hypothetical assets, right? So typically could be a. I don't know. Actually, one example would be a so called binary option. So, binary option would be the case where if the underlying stock of that option is getting a little ahead of ourselves, if the underlying stock of that option finishes below a certain strike price, then the option pays nothing. And if it finishes above a certain strike price, price for k four, and it doesn't matter, for a binary option, it wouldn't matter whether it's just above the strike price or trends way above the strike price. So there are assets like this out there, but trying to simplify the setting. Good. Other questions? So I'm shorting as a two. So I pick up four. So I get paid $4 for seven. Then I'm going to turn around and purchase 1.5 shares of Apple. That's going to cost me $3. So my net is at a transaction. Assume I do this simultaneously. My net, that is one. Yeah. This is assuming that you can short sell assets. That's kind of going to be an assumption for this class going forward, is that we can short sell assets. It doesn't cost us anything, and we can do so in unlimited quantity. Of course, these are some of the assumptions underlying CAPM, too. More on that later. Now, short selling. In the old days, short selling used to be somewhat expensive compared to purchasing assets. Purchasing assets are going long assets. Between you're borrowing security, there's costs involved with that. Those costs have come down tremendously. All of them not very expensive brokers. On the other hand, brokers out there, if you're just setting up a brokerage account with Schwab or something, they might make you sign a special probably type of agreement if you actually want short sell assets, because it's thought of for some reason as being riskier than going along. I guess it is riskier in a way, because if you think about short selling, you could sell an asset for say dollar 100 a share. And theoretically that asset could go up without bound. And in that case, you're losing money. If the asset goes up, you're losing money. Whereas on the downside, you're limited by this. If you go long $100 share, you're just limited to losing that hundred dollars. But yeah, typically you'll have to jump through many more hoops if you want a short sell out there. Obviously the big institutions are short selling essentially as much as they want. Good. Other questions? Okay, so then let's look at some more examples. It so let's suppose I've got two assets. Asset one pays off one and two, and a price of 1.5. Asset two pays off three and six. So this will be a classic type of thing you might see on an exam. And so we would present you with this table of information. Ask the question, is there an arbitrage opportunity? A and b? If so, how would you trade to exploit that opportunity? Is there an arbitrage opportunity here? And if so, how would you trade? Okay, so we could do this, we could short asset two and we prolong three shares of asset one. Alright, so what happens in that case? Well, what are, what's my path going to be in state one? I'm going to be long three shares of asset one. So I'll pick up three from my long position. I'll have to pay three for my short position. Again, I've got a net payoff of zero. Same thing here. I pick up six. For my long position, I pay off six. For my short position, pay off zero. So I've got no net exposure. And then my price, I pick up sip of five. Sorry. For my short position. In asset two, I pay 4.5. For my long position, I pick up 0.5. I pick up positive 0.5. Right now I've got no net exposure in Tampa chart. Okay, everybody good with that? Okay, let's throw in a third. Asset one pays up one or zero. Price is 0.3, asset two is up 0.1 as a price of 0.6. And then asset three is up two and three with a price of 2.8. All right. So, yeah, in this example, the idea is that we can, can think about combining assets, so we can set up a long or short position by combining assets. And again, we're trying to combine assets on the long side and combine assets on the short side. Such state continue payoffs are zero. And then we're looking for a different price for each of the long sides and short sides. And if we can do that, then we've got an arbitrage. Okay, so my question to you then is, is there an arbitrage opportunity in this case? Does everybody see that? So, if I combine two shares of asset one and three shares of asset two into a portfolio, that portfolio will have a payoff in state one of two and a payoff in state two of three. They'll have the same payoff as asset three. The cost of setting up that portfolio will be 2.42 shares of asset one. Cost is 0.63 shares of assets two, costing 1.8. That's a total of 2.4. So, I've got a portfolio with the same payoff as assets three, but a different price. I've got an arbitrage opportunity there. And what you do, essentially, you sell the more expensive side, and you purchase the lesser cheaper. So I sell one share of asset creed for 2.8, and then I use the proceeds from that sale to purchase two shares of asset one, three shares of asset 2.4 in my pocket. No. Yeah, this would be type one. I mean that, again, that distinction doesn't really matter, but that's the way it would be. All right, let's go back to a two asset example. Oh, and we'll come back to this idea. Well, I'll come back to that. Think about two as an example. What do I got? Two, four, three, and 36152 assets that I can trade in. And this is the case. Is there an arbitrage opportunity here? So, 1.5 times state contingent payoff of asset one gives you the same state contingent payoff as s of two. 1.5 times price is the same price. Right. So there is no arbitrage opportunity available. Okay, fairly simple. Let's try another one here. So, this is what I get, 10, 0.3. I get five, nine, 6.9, and then I've got zero, one. So, suppose this is the case. Is there enough to try to have arbitrary path? I try combine five. Well, if I combine five shares of asset one and nine shares of asset three, my portfolio would have the same payoffs as asset two, but that price would also be the same. So I get 1.5 and 5.4. So the cost of setting up that portfolio would be 6.9, same as price is asked of two. So, no. Arbitrary. All right, so let me give you. Yeah, so let's suppose I'm going to change the payout in state two to 0.1. So now this is a little trickier. Now we're thinking about type two arbitrage. Is there an arbitrage option? Actually, you want to above, it's close. You want to do just the opposite. So, yes, there is an arbitrage opportunity here. So what I can do is I can sell one share of Asset two. I'll pick up 6.9 for that. And then I'm going to buy five shares of Asset one and nine. Yeah, five shares of Asset one and nine shares of asset three. So break this down. Short one asset two, long five asset one plus nine asset three. Okay, so let's look at our state contingent payoff in that case. So state one happens, I collect five for my five shares of asset one. I pay five for my short position in asset two. And the net payoff is zero. If stage two happens, I collect 0.5%. Five for my asset one, I collect nine for asset three. So I guess my total proceeds are 9.5. I've got to pay off nine for asset two. And so I've got a positive payoff of 0.5. Then the cost of that, I got 6.9 for my short position, I paid 6.9, my long position that cost me nothing. This is called a zero cost portfolio. Zero cost portfolio. And what happens is that I have a positive probability I'm not going to make money for sure, because if state one happens, I get nothing, I break even. But if state two happens, I'll have a positive profit of 0.5. This is the case where, and there's no chance of losing money. So this is the case where I set up a zero cost portfolio that may make money in the future, but does not lose money. So this would be an example of type two arbitrage. All right. And then. Yeah, quickly, one thing, if I go back to this type of asset, this is a very special type of asset, which we'll have a lot more to say about later. But this is called an asset that pays off one in one state and zero in all other states. It's called an arrow to growth experience. We'll come back to that later. All right, I'll leave it there. See you guys on.

Doing something with a magnitude. And we talked about how to add vectors. First of all. So I have a vector a here and then I have a vector b. I just join the scale of a vector b to the head of vector a. And then by definition the sum of two vectors is going to be the vector drawn from the tail of the first on which they had. So that's kind of a graphical way that you could add vectors. But you know, we like that empirically. And so we talked about vectors components. This has some xy coordinate system. And I say I have some vector vector a like this, I can break that down into some points and vector components. So vector point ax would be vector like this. It could be the projection of the vector on the x axis. And then I would have a vector component ay the vector minus e to the y axis. And so I could write the vector overall vector as the sum of those two vector components. And then I also introduce scalar components. The scalar components are just the magnitude of the magic components. Well, possibly the minus sign which is going in the median direction. And then I also introduce unit vectors I j, k right vector, in other words, vector one going to the positive x direction j, dot is positive y and I. So unit vector form is possible to write any vector as its tailoring component as I have, plus the scale of y component times j. Max, if you want to add two vectors together, two vectors a and b, so b would be written as dx I hat j hat find out that the sum of the vectors of c. Then we get ax plus e x times I hat plus ky plus p y times j hat. And so the bottom line is this has to be the x component c. And this is lacking point. We should be able to get the components of a vector just by adding the components of the two individual vectors that we have. That's one argument for value to just simply add. Another way of looking at it is well, let's suppose that we have vector a like this, okay? And then we have vector v that we're adding to it. And I'm going to add this with a using Raphael method at the tail here. Okay, so this right here is a right, this right here is dx. As far as the vector C is concerned. C of course, would just be this vector here. Well you can see that this whole distance right here is just going to be Cx is B's. Now it's also true for the Y direction as well. Okay, so any questions about, okay, so what we do now is we were able to write down a kind of general procedure for adding vectors. Next step is combine x components together like I for Ydez if asked, we want to find anything direction. Any questions so far? Okay, so let's just do a simple example. Okay, so let's suppose that a man walks centimeters at 40 degrees, then 15 meters at three degrees left as much. So question, what's the next, what's the main conversion in at this place? Okay, so how are we going to do this? Well, we are going to have to do the first step. We are going to have to break it into components. Let's try coordinate axis here. And what's actually given is directions in the northeast. Actually we'll have positive x to the east, negative x to the west, positive north, negative y to the south, and represent those two individual movements by vectors a and B. So the vector a, you're going 40 meters, 40 degrees north of east, what direction this piece at four degrees, mark, it needs to be like that, four degrees to plot that x. So we draw that the a here is a 40 degree angle. And then the second vector e would be a 15 year long vector at 30 degrees west of north. So what's that? So this is more, could be this way. And so how should I draw it? I'm trying to break it into points. So I'm not going to take the vector b and place tail here and go like that. Okay, because that's not the method I'm using. I'm just trying to find points. And the easiest way to find points is to have a tail vector at the orient. So I have the vector b here, this is a 30 degree angle right there. Okay, so let's break the dominant components now. So vector a over vector times the cosine of 43, right. X to the polynomial vector can be written as the negative vector times the cosine of the angle counterclockwise from positive x. And then likewise ay is going to be a sine of vertices. So I can just plug those numbers in going to 7 meters. So ax is 5.4 meters, and then we're going to plug in the value for v. There I get 4.5 meters. Okay, so that was easy enough. Now what about the components of b? There's a couple ways that we can do this and one way is to, well, okay, so the component vectors, vector components of v are going to be a vector dx like this and the vector dy like that, right? So I have my right triangle formed here. The length of this is absolute value of dx, right. Triangle here and the length of this side is the absolute value. So I can say that the absolute value of dx divided by v as well. This is a figure of the angle between the opposite side divided by our continents. That's going to be multiply both sides by d. But then I should also remove the absolute. And when I do, I recognize, well, because vector component is pointed that way, I have to add a minus sign, negative b sine 30 degrees. And so it's going to be negative 50 meters. Sine 30 degrees is going to be negative 7.5. Right. So any questions so far? Okay, what about the Y component? So this is dy, right? Well, I'm going to call it absolute value of dy because of course it is positive. Same thing as dynamic side divided by the hypotenuse, of course is cosine of 30 degrees. And we've got some value symbols of anything. And I end up with 13 meters. That's one way that I could have done it. Is there another way I could have done it? I could have said Dx is equal to b times the cosine of what angle the angle is going to be. It's going to be 90 plus 3423 fractions. And not surprisingly, I didn't get five. And then the Y is going to be B times sine of r x. And that's the prior negative. Again, I encourage you to get comfortable with using angles that are not counterfactual. Positive x. It's going to be good if you feel comfortable doing that. All right, so any questions so far? Okay, so then Cx is equal to ax plus dx. So I just plug the numbers in, I get negative 2.1 meter ay plus a y. I plug those numbers in, I get seven 5 meters. And if I want to get negative. And we just use the pythagorean theorem for that 17.6 meters. And let's see, for the angle or the direction the tangent theta is equal to cy over cx. So when I plug those in, I get negative 8.3. I take the inverse tangent on my calculator and tell me that it's negative. So is that the final answer? Negative 83 degrees doesn't seem right, does it? Seems like it should be going off that way, not that way. Remember, there's always two angles theta such that when you take the tangent and get any particular value right, those two angles are separated by 183. So it could be -83 or it could be, which is 97 degrees. So in general, it's the easiest way to tell each of those two is the right one. I'm looking at the sine of the Cx is negative, Cy is positive. And so what part would that be? Well, we're going to work it in the same way that original directions were given to us in terms of north, south, east, west. This indeed. What? So any questions about y is what are you on now? Bx, why is it negative? Well, it has to be negative because the maximum exponent bx constant negative xdev direction. So by definition the scalar component would be the negative of that length right there. Anything else? Okay, so then now we're ready to move on to applying all this to motion has some xy coordinate x ray. And let's say I've got some particle. Let's say the particle is located right there, and I can define its position vector simply as a vector running from the origin to wherever that particle happens to be at that moment in time. So here's the vector of r heredae thing is, if particle is able to move around, which of course we're assuming again, then r is not just a constant, right? R is actually, and we could write it in terms of components, right. The position vector of time is going to be the x coordinate times. Also define a displacement factor as well. Displacement vector natural is going to be defined over some interval, right. Let's say I have a particle that's initially in here, I point I is the initial position point, f is the final position. And so then I'm going to have at the beginning of the time interval, some initial position vector r sub I, and then at the end some final position vector r sub father. And there's going to be a spacecraft vector delta r, which is simply the difference between r vector and r. This defined pretty much the same way that we did when it's placed, except this is the vector. So by definition you could say, well, this is r plus negative ri. So you could reverse ri and then add them like that. But I think this is a better way to do it. Let's rewrite this. We'll add the vector ri to both sides. We get rf equals ri plus delta r. So delta r is just naturally the vector that I need to add to our initial to get rid of move that way. What's going to be convector delta r? If r initial is this and delta r is vector in the end, get r final, then delta r, which is simply going to be a vector that runs from the initial to the final, which understand? Makes sense, right? Doesn't make sense clearly, that is running from the initial location for final. And it's kind of the origin of a coordinate system, right. If I knew this coordinate system that the origin is in a different place, the individual vectors ri and rf would change. Right? But when displacement vectors change, displacement vector would be exactly the same. All right, well, I guess what we're going to design next, now that we define displacement, we want the velocity, right? This is the average velocity, or average velocity is defined in some interval. And I mean, we can always coordinate over both times. I have. So say that I start off with some blank and wander around and eventually return my current point. What's the average velocity for the whole trip over zero means the initial plane positions are the same, right? So that's what r is, zero. What is the average t? Zero. No, the average speed is going to be whatever. This whole arc length is divided by the time. Okay, so any questions so far? Okay, let's come back next. Probably guess it's instantaneous. This is what we're being interested in, actually. How is the instantaneous velocity vector defined? Well, it's basically defined as the limit as delta t goes to zero, r over delta t. In other words, the limit of the average velocity as time interval. And by definition, we can say that that's the sine derivative of r d. We can always rewrite this as the limit as delta t goes to zero of this. Right? Delta x over delta p. I have this, you already know, is simply. And then the limit of that is just going to be yt. And so now you just know this is the xenore x coordinates and this is a y component. Ux is just simply the time derivative of the x coordinate. And the y is the answer of the y coordinate. So how does the instantaneous velocity vector relate to a path? Let's suppose I have a purpose traveling along like this. It happens to be at the moment. Well, if I consider a short time interval, then over that short time interval, let's say the time that it takes going from here over to here, I'm just going to sum displacement vectors off the out, right? And we sum the average velocity vector, which is going to be in that same direction. So if I imagine shrinking the time interval down to zero, this delta r, of course, has become more and more nearly tangent to that guess. In other words, it's going to be even more so. And so, basically, bottom line is that the velocity vector is always going to be tangent to a cap. There is no component of a velocity vector perpendicular to a. Captain, I can also define an average acceleration. Okay, so I can say that the average acceleration vector is instant change its velocity vector five at a time. Of course that's going to be delta dx, delta v y. And then I can find this a, and this case, acceleration actually is just a limit. DElta E goes to zero of delta v over delta t. And that, my definition is just simply and just like it looks out over there. Okay, so any questions about that? So it's good to have included field for how the acceleration vector relates to the path of the particle and motion of the particle. So let's first consider a particle traveling straight down. Now let's just take the piece of the, not just thrown up into here. So let's suppose that down here, and then when it's down here has some initial velocity vector like this. And then when it gets up to here, it has some final velocity vector like this. So it's still going upwards, but of course it's slow down, so the vector is shorter. So what's the direction of the acceleration? Well, first of all, delta v is equal to d final b initial. Or we can say that b final is the vector that needs to be added to the initial. Sorry. Delta v is effective. That needs to be added. So what I could do is I could just take b final and put it right here. So the vector that would need to be added to be initial here to be final, that's going to be a vector that runs down and that's going to be the direction of the average acceleration. Well, actually in this case, acceleration is constant anyway. So that's going to be the direction of the acceleration vector as well. Vector is this way as it should be, right. And then on the way down, well, on the way down, let's say, has some velocity there. But then when it's gone down to the lower elevation velocity like that. So what would be the direction of acceleration? Move the vector v initial here. So delta b is a vector. I need to add the b initial in order to get the final. So that would be this vector here. And so the acceleration vector begins with the down. Makes sense, right? The acceleration vector is down in both cases. But the bottom line is, and this is just something that's generally not just dealing with the, is that if the acceleration vector and the velocity vector are in the same direction, what's happening to the axis? It's speeding up, right? That's what's happening here, acceleration vector in the same direction velocity. That means that the change in velocity is in that same direction. So it must be speeding up. But what if there are opposite directions, like in this case over here? Well, then in that case, it's slowing down. Any questions so far? Oh, yes. Why? Delta v is pointed out. So delta v is the vector that I need to add in. This will get. So this could be initial. I move v prime over so that we're here, right. L could be as vector. I need to add this in order to get this. I think that's just an easier way to do it than to go. Okay, delta v is mu plus negative. The initial. We could do it that way. Yes. Having trouble hearing you a second. The delta B vector should be in the same direction as the acceleration. Well, first of all, the average acceleration, by definition, is just delta v over delta T. And delta T is just a positive scale, right? So now, of course, you know, you could have something that's not a constant acceleration. In that case, you know, the instantaneous acceleration might be different, but it's still the same idea, right? The acceleration vector is going to, for small intervals, and the acceleration vector has to be in the same direction as delta D. Okay, so what about, so if I just got in line first half. So let's say that it's traveling at constant cube. So let's figure out what the acceleration is going to be at the very top right here. So let's consider this time that both the, when it's here to, when it's over here like this, the final velocity vector like that. But for the constant scheme, those two vectors should be the same length. Okay, so I have an initial velocity vector that's like this and a final velocity vector that's like this and final. So delta V is down. So the average acceleration has to be downwards as well. But as long as I shrink the interval size to zero, these two come in, the average acceleration is still going to be pointed in the same direction, right. If I shrink the interval down, these two vectors just simply come closer together. But delta v is still going to point out. So we get some acceleration is also going to be coming downwards. So in this case, the acceleration vector is perpendicular to the path and it's directed inwards. Or what if objects are traveling along the earth, but not at a constant speed at changing speed? So here we are again. But the velocity vector, velocity vector is not the same length at the beginning. And at the end we have a length like this over here. So if I were to draw the vector v would be like this, the final would be like this. And so the vector that I need to add to v initial get. The final is going to be this. So the asteroid acceleration vector is actually going to be pointed off this way. And again, in the limit of the time, it will use accelerations when you're in that same direction as I make the time interval shorter and shorter. These are going to be more and more nearly the same length. They're going to come together, but it's still going to point along. I can break that vector down into components. I could call this component here a perpendicular, and this component I could call a curve. So what's the significance in each of nothing to do with changing direction whatsoever. And then what does v perpendicular have to do with. Nothing really to do with changing speed at all. All right, so any questions about any of that? Okay, so what we're going to do next is we're going to move, actually a specific example of two dimensional math, very important category of motion, something that is called projectile motion. So what is projectile motion of the definition? Well, you see, it's motion only after the end of the graph. Wait a minute, that's just what free fall motion was. What's the difference? Well, actually, projectile motion and free fall motion, I guess you could say the previous thing, but still the terminology is used generally in different situations. Generally is free fall motion when the motion is just straight up and down, and projectile motion when there's a horizontal component to the motion. But I mean, projectile motion is recalled motion, vertical motion, projectile motion, really now, so we're going to have dx equals dx dt. Mean y is equal to dy dt, and we have both horizontal and vertical motions. Well, first of all, actually, how should we even define this horizontal axis here? So let's say I take an object and let's say I'm doing it in this direction. What I'm going to do is I'm going to find the positive x axis to be that way. In other words, the projection of the initial velocity vector down that way. And then the positive y direction is straight up. So that being the case, the initial velocity vector is going to be the initial axis I have plus the initial y z. And then what can I say about the. There's not going to be any z components. The velocity vector. By defining a velocity, what can I say about the acceleration vector? I say that, well, x is zero and ay is a. And of course, ez would be equal to zero also. But the bottom line is if Ez is zero and there's not even any velocity on the z direction, then that means nothing at all is happening along the z direction, right. If I toss the object this way, the motion is going to take place within a plane because there's no third dimension I really need to worry about. So I have DX equals the XDT. Also remember that those equations for uniform acceleration all came, and all equations for exponents changes from this equation and this, right. And likewise, the same constant acceleration comes from this and this. So we found that we can just use the constant acceleration. We don't have to drive anything from scratch. The motions, the equations for the y motion are exactly the same as what we had in fourth with free fall motion, these are going to be the equations. And then I would have the same equations for the expulsions. But because the acceleration is zero, of course, I don't really end up with four equations, right? If you just take acceleration to zero, I mean, basically the four equations collapse down into intuitively, e final x equals the initial x and store the x velocity should be constant if there's no acceleration on the x expression, and delta x equals v initial x l c. Now, since it's looking at problem x and y points of the velocity vector field, figure out what they are. They'll give you the initial speed and initial direction. But they already know how to handle that, right? So we have some v initial angle beta, naturally, v initial x, cosine beta initial. And the initial y is the initial minus sine of the x. But remember that we always define the positive x direction to be in the direction of motion by cross program. This way it's another. And so this angle is limited. It can't be a curve or a four. Positive angle theta has to be somewhere between negative 90 degrees and positive 90 degrees. Okay, so what would the shape of the trajectory be? What precise mathematical shape is that? So let's see, we can combine these equations here. Delta x is v initial x, delta e, and then delta y, delta t minus one half t delta t squared. So what we can do is we combine. I just find delta y as a function. Delta x. That's what I really want. I want to get rid of those delta t's. So I just take off delta t, delta x. And then when I plug it in. So I'm going to get v initial y over v initial x times delta x, right? I'm going to plug this into here, and then I'm going to get minus g over two the initial x squared of x squared. So this, of course is a constant. That's a constant. So what shape is that? If it's a quadratic it's a parabola array, of course. All right, so any. Any final questions? Okay, so I noticed. They will go into detail on how you self projectile.

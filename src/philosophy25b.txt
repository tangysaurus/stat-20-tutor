Jesus. Ideas are what adequate error really are not in a position to know. Of course, exercise would be like, we're not getting into all of the here. Okay? So what we did look at last time is first part of part two. What we see there is very that minds can only cause changes in mind and body. Changes in body. Causation has to be attribute. I say that there are more restrictions on what can cause one. As I say in part one, that if you've got an infinite cause, then you're going to get an infinite effect, because you've got the system going to be anything limited to infinite substances. Once you do have finite things, then those finite, so get attributes, discussion, causation, that's happening just six. And when we ended last time, really, we were talking about what parallelism, which is articulated into e seven. The statement of that proposition is the order and connection. Ideas is the same as the order and connection. And so what I think does do is think of what's going on there in the following way, that evidence used in that way. And so we can say that God has an infinite intellect. There's infinite intellect consisting of all of those ideas, all going from God's nature. So all of those ideas are going to be perfectly flexible, all available ideas, all of those ideas are going to be true and perfectly represent what is happening in the causal series. So you've got bodies doing things with other bodies, giving rise to modes bodies, you have a causal order there. And what in the attribute of thought there are representing that causal order, the order of connection of ideas, what is represented in thought matches what is actually real. So there's just a perfect correspondence between what's happening in thought and what's happening in extension. Look at what ideas represent, representation, and then what is happening in extension. The last time I put this parallelism in terms of objective reality, agreed with, and there's a reason here, there's perfect agreement, because you just have the same, you have the same thing, the same structure that is being conceived in attributed thought, something objectively real. Or the attribute of extension is something formally real or body. So we talked about last time how if you have an idea of a particular struggle and you represent it in thought, and you represent it as existing, and if it's a true idea, though there will be a circle in extension, that is some way real, there'll be the same circle. On one hand you're thinking of it, on the other hand you're thinking of it. So this is just different words, but circle existing in nature, which I'm taking, and the idea of the existing circle, which is also in God, which I'm taking, just the objective of real circle are one of the same thing, which is explained to different attributes. I think this is just an easy way of seeing how understanding parallelism in terms of representation. So you have ideas representing. So the human mind, according to Spinoza, is just an idea. There are many ideas within ideas. An idea can be extraordinarily complex, but at base, what the human mind is, according to Spinoza, is an idea of a body. So minds, for Spinoza, are individuated because bodies are individuated, or if you want to think about it the other way, bodies are individuated because minds are individuated by a certain context. You have the parallelism of one co mission, but crucially, you have human mind. What, it's an idea, and it represents one body. So this can explain why we as minds, have access to what's happening in our bodies, because our mind just represents our body, what happens in our body. So this is how Spinoza understands the union of the mind and body. So you've got one of the same things. You can see some different attributes. You've got an idea of the body in thought. You've got the form of your body in extension. And that idea, thought, represents the body in extension. So you have this access to what's happening in extension. You're unified with your body. And he's listened to his account of the union. So I will point out we didn't read these passages, but for those of, like, Descartes, it looks like some of those like Descartes can also be understood as making the distinction we saw Descartes making, like your mind can be conceived as an idea either in terms of what it represents, his objective reality, or in terms of just the activity of thinking. We do see that. But the key proposition where some of, like, here's what the human mind is, two p 13 object of the idea constituting the human mind is the body. That is a certain mode of extension which actually exists. That's just what the human mind is, representation of the body. So in schooling, important to understand the human body, what the human body does, because that can help us understand what's special about the human mind. So unlike Descartes, who thought that human minds were really special, in that human beings are the only creatures that are created as a union of mind and body. Denova, you'll note, doesn't this union to just human minds, this doesn't mean to say that he doesn't think that human minds can do things that other minds can't. But he's going to say, be an explanation for why human minds do what they do. They have human brains in human body. That's the explanation we can explain. We can say the dogs have minds representing their bodies. They have a brain, it's a dog brain, and they've got a mind that represents that dog brain. The rest of the body and dog mind think about certain things. And the way the dog is thinking is going to be different from how human beings think. But you have an explanation for what that is. Brain is part of the body. So the explanation 13, as he makes some of this explicit, so he said, the things we've shown so far completely general and do not pertain more to man, human beings and to other individuals, all of which, though in different degrees, but nevertheless animate everything has a corresponding mind, even this carpet. There's a mind that is representing that carpet, a chair. It's not a very complicated mind representing a chair. Body can't do very much because the body doesn't have very many parts that can't do very much. Completely general thesis. Because of each thing, there's necessarily an idea of God, which God, whatever. So that parallelism is going to hold for all bodies. It's not going to be anything which. So animals, plants aren't just mere bodies, they're not mere machines, as state park would have kind of lemur, remember? Is it a chinchilla? No. Could be. Anyway, that adorable nocturnal. I'm sure it has a mind and it has mind representing its body. Whatever differences between the way that this animal thinks, the way that we think is due to the fact that the mind represents different pheromones. It's got a different kind of body. And so what it thinks about is also going to be reasonable. Animals that are machine because they have mind object. Will you say this mind? It's not the result, it's just. It's just parallel to it. For any body, there's a line representing body. And so you can individuate lines. Bodies are individuated, but you can also run in the other way. Bodies are individuated the way that they are. So he would say, insofar as you're thinking of them as extended, not going to be thinking of those bodies as thinking they're bodies. Think of the bodies as objectively wheel and objects of thought. So it's not like you would be totally happy thinking. That implies that the body itself is thinking, but bodies are extended. Thought is not an attribute. Bodies do not bodies. It's just we can take the body, recognize that that body has a certain structure, and we recognize that that structure is also represented in thought. And insofar as it's been thought, it is being thought of and it's a representation. There's this idea representing that chair, and it's that idea that it's thinking about the chair. So it's not the chair itself. You can speak loosely and say, well, for Spinoza, things that we as a Cartesian might not have proper thinking, indeed do have minds. So this plant, he might not have thought, has a mind he wasn't even willing to acknowledge. Animal has a minded that way. There's no evidence he's going to argue that you've got a body necessarily, because you just got one substance, and it's mode conceive of this one substance. When we think of the attribute of extension and thought, we just do get this parallelism structure. And you just have to recognize that if you've got a body, there must be mind body. Is there no need or is there no need yet? Because I know that issue the same question like we asked here, but does it not hold? Because, I mean, it's sort of like you don't need to worry about figuring out how the interfaces, I think, but you can provide a complete cosmology of what's going on in mind in terms of what's going on in ideas, the realm of ideas. And then there will be a corresponding explanation within extension, because the order of connection of causes is the same thing there is that one, and the sameness of structure there. This isn't to say that you can have an idea of causation that is not under some attributes. So it's not like you can just have an attribute. You can understand causes in a totally neutral saying like this mind is one of the same as this body. Let's just call that thing b, caused by thing a, which could be conceived as these different attributes. He doesn't think that you really are understanding causation or reality or anything, unless you're thinking of it under. Okay, so in the story, it says a little bit more about just how to, even if we're just looking at human mind, he says, if you have a body that is kind of able to control its environment, able to kind of do things affected by certain things, we're being able to do other things, then the corresponding mind is like to have things that a body skill would have had, but in proportion as the actions of a body depend more on itself alone. Other bodies concur with it less than acting. So mind is more capable of understanding. I think what he's saying here is if you've got a body that has enough total power, all of you have enough power, so you don't have to worry. But you are in control of. But you're able to move through the world remaining intact. You don't dissolve when you move or are moved. You're able to resist the affections of other things that's affecting other bodies, affected you. You're able to control your environment. You've got a mind that isn't just responding to, isn't just perceiving what is happening in body. And just like only having perceptual ideas, you have a mind body, a body, a brain that can kind of do things that aren't directly relevant to survival. And so then you can have corresponding mind that's also doing, not just related to keeping yourself alive. Like you're here, your body here is your brain is doing certain things and able to think about something more than. But the point is your brain is able to do things, and your mind represents that, right? The basic point is just understand differences mind by looking at differences among corresponding bodies, again, including brains. This is why, I mean, after this scolium, you get a kind of mini treatise on physics. You might be like, why is this here? All of a sudden we get some new actions, dilemmas. Well, he's just saying a little bit more about the nature of bodies. And he's saying all bodies agree in certain things. There's going to be things that all bodies do. And it's in virtue of all of that universal bodies that they're going to be ideas that all minds can have. He's going to develop this idea later, but this is why he's introducing this many trees on physics, where he is one thing that we do is complex bodies. And you can individuate body each other. But just the nature of a body is going to be ratio of motion, rest in one part. And I emphasize here, because mathematical ratio, you can think of that ratio as a ratio among bodily actual extended parts in extension, or you can think of that ratio as a ratio obtaining between ideas of bodily part. So you get the same structure and thought that, you see, this is just another way of seeing one in the same thing conceived in different attributes. Take your seat. Something like a circle. It's like that circle of nature and the idea. Keep your questions. I'm going to just take stock kind of zoom out a little bit and then I'll lift up the discussion. Okay, which is taking. So here is one kind of dualism we see in Descartes. So you've got substances created by God coming into flavors, the extended flavor and the thinking flavor. They're both created substances. Minds are essentially thinking. Bodies are essentially extended. For Descartes, if you have conceptually displayed attributes, if you can see one without the other. Saw that in six meditation, that's going to indicate a real distinction between substances, that you've got two attributes. You can sort of distinction between reality. These things could exist, and there's some mind body interaction, or at least there's not a worry about. So we see Spinoza giving us a kind of monism that's contrasted to that cartesian dualism just described. So you do have attributes of extension, thought. Being conceptually independent, you can think of what's extended without what is thinking. The attributes are the same conceptually from each other. That's how arguments in part one are able to work. But you can't infer from the fact about thought as whether there's anything extended. You can't infer from that that there's morality of substances. There's just one substance, God, that can be conceived. And where we saw possibility of mind body causation and thought, Elizabeth, words would take part in all that here. No, there's not causal interaction there. Causation is always within attributes. So you don't have to worry about how these different attributes or the most different attributes interface extended, kind of because there was extended and an infinite substance, an eternal infinite substance. And then minds and bodies are substances. For daycard, they're different kind of substance. So this is just setting the attributes aside and just thinking about just goddess substance. You've got Descartes substance. That's necessarily infinite, eternal thinking, but not extended. It's benevolent. And minds and bodies don't necessarily don't exist by virtue of their own nature alone. They have to be caused by God to exist. They have to be created and continuously, continuously created by God. But God doesn't need to create anything. God could just. There's not an essence like the creation of substances. For Descartes doesn't just follow God's own nature. God's existence follows Descartes, but not the creation of the world. And you can have finite substances that are finite. They don't last forever. Human body, at least not going to last forever. You might have some that are everlasting. God chooses to create, to continuously create a created mind, you could have a mind outlast forever, a temporal finite body, but you don't have the time or fraternity. So Spinova, again, Descartes, he's not going to call them infinite. So infinite is something that Descartes reserves for the reality of God. So even if we suppose that God creates a mind, a human mind, and even though that mind body union breaks down because the body dies, even if God chooses to keep that mind in existence for all of the rest of time, that existence still isn't the infinite existence. It would just be a continuation for Descartes, infinite, like you just would not use the word infinite to describe creat. So he might say have something that doesn't come to an end if I choose. But that reality would still be understood in terms of finite, would be that God is going to have that reality. Okay, we still see God as necessarily infinite, eternal substance, but God has one and only substance, and that one substance can be conceived under different absence. And God isn't benevolent. That's your objection. God is just nature. Nature is not something good, particular intentions or dispositions, doesn't associate reality with foundational reality, with any kind of everything else is just going to be a mode, an affection modification of that one. Where we still see, though this idea that most depends for their very existence on substance. For Descartes you still had created substances depending on God's causal activity for their continued existence here mode still positively depend on God. But God is an imminent cause of these. In causing God's own existence, God supports the being of modes of that all modes are, though necessarily caused by God. Illexistence isn't part of the essence of any modes. But it's still the case for Spinova and not for Descartes, that God necessarily creates it either as extended or thinking. You don't have morality of these two substances, and you don't have to get into the same concerns about how to understand the union of mind and body. That was kind of stepping back and now opening question either attributes. Yeah, God first, you know that like we have to say that God only had access to two extension. You might think, how do we know that there are all these two equals two? Or I think you would say, look, we can know that given the considerations we give in part one about power to exist, we have to see that God couldn't lack any attributes. There are other attributes. We can know that. That doesn't mean that we can see God under any of those attributes. We just can't do that. We're limited in that way extended, he would say moving. There's ability to think and there's a body there and we're able to continue extending ourselves. Being a certain type of thing. I think there's still a question of like why, why don't we have access to the other attributes? If you just have one substance and bones and any of those under infinity of attributes, like what prevents from accessing. He doesn't answer it. So it is how nature is. Human beings have access to these two attributes. That's what human beings are. We all can agree that human beings think and have bodies. He's concerned ultimately to provide ethics for human beings. So he's not going to get too wrapped up in concerns about aliens and things like that. You might think given how much weight he gives on intelligibility, you might worry that he's kind of introducing him. I think he's not. So some things just are not that I know. Yeah, I mean, extensions like these are just. Everyone seems to agree we're going to see. Not everyone agrees that extension is its own attribute, but we're going to see like this reality. Everyone can agree that like fake and we have audience like that. We think we'll give the body so that people, we think of it and people know. So are you, are you thinking of the form or. Yeah, so are you. Let me just read. That's.
